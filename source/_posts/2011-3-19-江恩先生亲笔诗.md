A STANDARD 
To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. 
To make all your friends see that there is something in them. 
To look at the funny side of everything and make your op- 
timism come true. 
To think only of the best, to work only for the best, and to 
expect only the best. 
To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you 
are about your own. 
To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater 
achievements of the future. 
To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every 
living creature you meet a smile. 
To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that 
you have no time to criticize others. 
To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong 
for fear; and too happy to permit the presence of 
trouble. 
To think well of yourself and to proclaim this face to the 
world, not in loud words but in great deeds. 
To live in the faith that the whole world is on your side so 
long as you are true to the best that is in you. 
-W.D.Gann

标准 
坚强，以至于你的平静不被任何事情所打扰 
让你所有的朋友看到其中的价值 
看着所有可笑的事情，最终使你乐天的梦想成真 
善于思考、善于工作、善于期待 
对于别人的成功就像对待自己的成功一样热情 
忘记过去的错误、努力争取未来的伟大成果 
善意地对待世间的所有生物、你会赢得微笑 
花费所有时间提高自己、以至于没有时间批评别人 
强大到不用忧虑、高贵到不会发怒、强壮到不需恐惧 
幸福以至麻烦都不能出现 
用伟大的行动、而不是高昂的声音，表现你自己 
忠实地生活，整个世界将会站在你的一边
